This is a modified version of embedded gmetric written in Python. It has been modified from

http://code.google.com/p/embeddedgmetric/

Main changes are

  - Support for Ganglia 3.1
  - Ability to specify metric group which gets grouped in the Ganglia Web UI. 


Latest version can also be used inside your own Python code with optionally
reading system's gmond.conf e.g.

========= CODE ==========

from gmetric import get_gmetrics

# Parse the config file to get all gmetric channels
gmetrics = get_gmetrics('/etc/ganglia/gmond.conf')
spoof = "%s:%s" % (hostname, hostname)

Then you can do thins like these

    for gmetric in gmetrics:
        gmetric.send('uptime', uptime,
                     TYPE='float', UNITS='seconds', SPOOF=spoof,
                     GROUP='mydaemon', DMAX=20)
        gmetric.send('some_count', upstreamCount,
                     TYPE='float', SPOOF=spoof, UNITS='count',
                     GROUP='mydaemon', DMAX=3600)

It was much easier to figure out proper XDR packet packing in his code than looking through the C code
