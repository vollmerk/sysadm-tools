=== BEEGFS manifests ===

  These are pretty basic, config files are used in decending order

  $FQDN,$DOMAIN,default

  The config files are located in ./modules/beegfs/files/[service]/ just
  add accordingly. 

  puppet apply [metadata.pp|admon.pp] --modulepath=modules

=== Setting your system up for BEEGFS ===

 Information taken from - http://www.fhgfs.com/wiki/ManualInstallWalkThrough#config_startup

 1. Create/Select Filesystems

  You'll need a metadata partition that supports extents, EXT4 supports it you should be able
  to adjust the mount by adding user_xattrs to the mount options. If creating a new partition
  then the following is a recommended formating line

    mkfs.ext4 -i 2048 -I 512 -J size=400 -Odir_index,filetype,^extents /dev/sdX

 2. Set the Disk scheduler to deadline

  Set the scheduler for your metadata disks to deadline to preference responsiveness over fairness

    echo deadline > /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler

 3. Disable redhat_transparent_hugepage for RHEL systems

  According to BeeGFS folks this causes performance and stability issues under high load and should be disabled

    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled

  On non-RHEL systems it can be done using the following method

    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

 4. Install Management server

   This system doesn't do any real work just coordinates the whole thing,
   this can be on any system connected to all others.

     puppet apply management.pp --modulepath=modules

 5. Install Admon server

   The pretty interface, I would recommend installing this on the same system
   as the management server, configure it to point at the management server
    
   
     puppet apply admon.pp --modulepath=modules

 6. Install Metadata server
 
   Update the config file with your management server, and the location for
   your metadata. 

     puppet apply metadata.pp --modulepath=modules

 7. Install Storage server

   Update the config file with your management server, and the location to
   be mounted as an available storage source

     puppet apply storage.pp --modulepath=modules

 8. Setup mount

   Reference the /etc/fhgfs/fhgfs-client.conf config file, see "default" 
   example, format is 

     /path/to/mount /path/to/client/configfile

 9. Install client

   Point the client at the management server, adjust any build flags that
   make sense for your environment
     
     puppet apply client.pp --modulepath=modules

 10. Verify using the Admon server (Java App)

   Verify that everything is working using the admon server Java app
